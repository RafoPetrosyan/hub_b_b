## Environment Variables

### Application Configuration

- `NODE_ENV` - Application environment (`development` or `production`)
- `BASE_URL` - Base URL for the application (used for local file URLs)
  - Development: `http://localhost:3000`
  - Production: `https://your-domain.com`

### File Upload Configuration

#### Development (Local Storage)

- `UPLOAD_LOCAL_PATH` - Local path where files are stored (optional, defaults to `./public/uploads`)

#### Production (Amazon S3)

The following environment variables are **required** when `NODE_ENV=production`:

- `AWS_REGION` - AWS region where your S3 bucket is located (e.g., `us-east-1`, `eu-west-1`)
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - AWS access key ID for S3 access
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - AWS secret access key for S3 access
- `S3_BUCKET` - Name of your S3 bucket for file storage

### Example .env File

```env
# Application Environment
NODE_ENV=development

# Base URL for the application (used for local file URLs)
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Local Upload Path (only used in development)
UPLOAD_LOCAL_PATH=./public/uploads

# Amazon S3 Configuration (required for production)
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-aws-access-key-id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-aws-secret-access-key
S3_BUCKET=your-s3-bucket-name

# Database Configuration
DATABASE_HOST=localhost
DATABASE_PORT=5432
DATABASE_USERNAME=postgres
DATABASE_PASSWORD=postgres
DATABASE_NAME=app_dev

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-key
```

### Notes

- In **development** mode, files are stored locally in the `UPLOAD_LOCAL_PATH` directory
- In **production** mode, files are uploaded to Amazon S3
- The application will throw an error on startup if S3 credentials are missing in production mode
- Make sure your S3 bucket has proper CORS configuration if you need to access files from a web browser
- Ensure your AWS credentials have the necessary permissions to read/write to the S3 bucket
